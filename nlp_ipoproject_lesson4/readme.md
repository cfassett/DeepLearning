<p>The code here does not include the data or models.  If you want the language model or resulting models, I have them pickled on disk.  Email me...

<p>I found the accuracy of the language model step in  step2 in my logs:<br>
<p>epoch     train_loss  valid_loss  accuracy  time<br>
0         1.997134    2.184785    0.563025  1:16:08<br>
1         1.998549    1.938984    0.604922  1:15:58<br>

<p>That's during the unfrozen training for fine_tuned_v4.
